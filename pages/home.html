	<p><strong>Docker Introduction</strong></p>
Docker is an extraordinarily popular open source containerization platform among developers. Docker enables developers to develop, ship, and run applications through its implementation of containers. Containers are a piece of software that packages up any code and its dependencies, enabling applications to run on various computing environments regardless of differences between system requirements from one computer to another. This popular method of running and delivering apps opens a world of possibilities, with a common use being businesses rolling out updates to existing software, and reverting back to older stages of a software if any errors arise.

<p><strong>Starting with Docker</strong></p>
<p>
Docker utilizes a special file called a Dockerfile. a Dockerfile is a file that automatically runs a set amount of code within an application to assemble an image (an image is a set of code that creates a container within docker). One such example of a Dockerfile is included below, which is used to run the NewsAPI app from our class' project.

<p><strong>Create a docker file</strong></p>
<p>
To create a docker file for your own web app, you will need to clone a copy of your git repository (repo). One way to acquire the link to your repo is by navigating to your repo on github.com. Using my own repo as an example, navigate to the `Code` tab
</p>
<p>
Inside the docker playground, on the left hand side of the screen, click the "+ Add New Instance" option.
